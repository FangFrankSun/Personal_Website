# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="25px" style="max-width:100%;"></a> ,<br>
a senior student double majoring in [Architecture](https://www.arch.virginia.edu) and [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) (joined August 2019). I love both tracks and hope to design smart architecture in the near future as my major career goal. 
  
I am also a chess national master with uscf rating 2359, and I have my own firm called [Hummer Education](https://www.littlehummerchess.club), dedicated to help more people learn better chess skills. And now we started to do software development courses as well, with online tutorials in Chinese for most of them.
